<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

TutorsAreUs is a subsidiary of Available Group LLC which started as Available Tutors in August 2007 in the Washington DC metropolitan area.The company is based on the efficacy of one on one learning, versus learning in groups. It started as an in home tutoring company that matched students with tutors. We wanted families to be able to spend more time together and not have to stress about homework, projects, school work and so on. Its goal is for students to have straight “ As” and we have achieved this by working with students and families to let this happen. It has a standard that tutors follow and we do background checks for all Tutors.
